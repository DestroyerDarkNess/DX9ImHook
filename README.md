# How to use :

1) Download and Build the project.
2) You will get **DX9ImHook.dll** , which you will export Function **dllmain.EntryPoint** with my project: - [Unmanaged.Net](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Unmanaged.Net)
4) Inject the exported DLL in a game that uses DirectX9 for example haloCE
5) If you still can't get the project working, then contact me on my discord. **(You will find it in my github profile.)**
